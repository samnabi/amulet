## More about this app

Creating an amulet from scratch is no easy task. You might go through hundreds of versions of a poem, trying different variations of wording and capitalisation, before stumbling upon one that qualifies as an amulet.

We can use computers to help us generate amulets — feed a massive set of words into an algorithm and comb though the results to find one that's particularly poetic. But where's the fun in that?

This scratchpad attempts to strike a middle ground. As you write your poem, it will scan the multiverse for similar poems — these could use different capitalisation, or synonyms of the words you've written. The exact poem you wrote might not be an amulet, but a similar one could very well be.

If stumbling upon an amulet is like rolling dice, this scratchpad loads the dice in your favour.

This app uses the Merriam-Webster thesaurus API to find synonyms. If we hit the daily usage limit it likely won't work properly.
